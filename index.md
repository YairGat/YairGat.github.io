# About Me
I am an M.Sc. student in Data Science [@Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/) under the supervision of Professor [Roi Reichart](https://iew.technion.ac.il/~roiri/). 
The topics of my research are NLP and causal inference. Also, I'm fascinated by the theory behind neural networks and various aspects of computer vision.
